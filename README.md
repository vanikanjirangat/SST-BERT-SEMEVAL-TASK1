# Semantic-Shift-Tracing-by-Clustering-in-Embedding-Space

The approach uses K-means clustering over contextualized BERT embeddings to detect whether the sense of a given target word has changed/not(Task 1). Further, these clusters are used to derive the ranking of the target words, which defines the degree of the semantic divergences (Task 2).
